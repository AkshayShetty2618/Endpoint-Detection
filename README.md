-To access the IDS camera via python the pyueye library must be installed. This can be done via the pip command.
-To use the IDS camera over the Jetson interface the relevent IDS software suite must be installed from the IDS website. For this project the 4.95 SDK version was installed.
- If the camera is not read after the installation modify the IPv4 setting to Link-Local Only under Network Connections.
